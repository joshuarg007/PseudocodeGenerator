# PseudocodeGenerator
 This program defines a simple modeling system for vehicles, including `Car`, `Truck`, and `Driver` classes, along with their attributes and methods. It generates pseudocode representations of these classes and saves the detailed structure in a YAML file, allowing for easy visualization and documentation of the class relationships and functionalities.
